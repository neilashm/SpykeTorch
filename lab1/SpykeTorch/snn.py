# planes. It doesn't involve weight-sharing, which is more biologically plausible compared to regular convolution
# with weight sharing.
# You can view this class as building a layer consisting of columns arranged in a 2D 'rows x cols' grid. In our case, it will be # just a 1 x 1 grid of 1 column. But DON'T HARDCODE THIS.
# Each such column has 'out_channels' number of neurons. Each such neuron looks at a Receptive Field which has 'in_channels'
# number of channels, with each channel being a 2D grid of size 'kernel_size x kernel_size'
# Note that with the current cumulative spike wave mapping, a 2D convolution of input with weights implements nothing but a
# step-no-leak neuron
